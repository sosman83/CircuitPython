# CircuitPython
My CircuitPython assignments
## Hello CircuitPython
### Objective
This assignment was an introduction to the cool new programming language and metro Express. My goal is to code our new metro.

### Lesson
 My first assignment using the new program. I learned a lot of basic stuff about Circuit Python. I learned how to code to our new metro.
 
## CircuitPython Servo
### Objective
My goal was to make a servo move using capacitive touch using CircuitPython.

### Lessons
 I learned what PMW Does. I learned capacitive touch is when the metro can detect and make the servo move when its touched.  I also learned how to move a servo on CircuitPython.
## CircuitPython LCD
### Objective
This assignment use the LCD screen to count the number of times a button was pressed, and the direction of counting should be determined by a switch.

### Lessons
I learned  "True" and "False" can prevent the count from going up while the button is pressed down.
## CircuitPython Photointerrupters
### Objective
The Photo interrupter should count the number of times it has been interrupted and print this message every four seconds without using  time.sleep()

### Lessons
I learned how to be patience
I learned that time.monotonic() tracks the time since the program started, and I learned that the MOD function only prints a message when the time is divisible by four.
## CircuitPython Distance Sensor

Thin to it cool new programming lanwas ae
The on-board neopixle RGB LED should change colors based on the distance read by the ultrasonic sensor.

### Lessons
I learned how the on-board RGB LED works and that you have to used absolute valus and integer functions to find the distance with the ultrasonic sensor.
## Classes Objects and Modules
### Objective
This assignment introduced was create our own modules. This assignment had us make a module for 2 RGB LEDs.

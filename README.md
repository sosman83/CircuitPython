# CircuitPython
My CircuitPython assignments
## Hello CircuitPython (and Metro and Mu)
### Objective
This assignment was an introduction a really cool new programming language and metro. The Metro looks similar to the arduino, but in function, it's very differnent. Metro express runs CircuitPython. The assignment was to code our new metro to make it have an LE>
### Pictures
### Lesson
This was our first assignment so I am starting to learn the basics of CircuitPython, more specifically, I learned what PMW (pulse width modulation) I also learned what the duty_cycle is.
## CircuitPython Servo
### Objective
The goal of this asignment was to make a servo move using capacitive touch using CircuitPython.
### Pictures
### Lessons
I learned that capacitive touch is when the metro can detect and make the servo move when you touch wires. I also learned how to move a servo on CircuitPython.
## CircuitPython LCD
### Objective
The LCD screen counted the number of times a button was pressed, and the direction of counting should be determined by a switch.
### Pictures
### Lessons
I learned that you use "True" and "False" to prevent the count from going up while the button is pressed down.
## CircuitPython Photointerrupters
### Objective
The Photo interrupter should count the number of times it has been interrupted and print this message every four seconds without uisng time.sleep()
### Pictures
### Lessons
I learned that time.monotonic() tracks the time since the program started, and i learned that the MOD function only prints a message when the time is divisible by four.
## CircuitPython Distance Sensor
### Objective
The on-board neopixle RGB LED should change colors based on the distance read by the ultrasonic sensor.
### Pictures
### Lessons
I learned how the on-board RGB LED works and that you have to used absolute valus and integer functions to find the distance with the ultrasonic sensor.
## Classes Objects and Modules
### Objective
Create a new module that lets you call functions to turn (off-board) RGB LEDs certian colors.
### Pictures
### Lessons
I learned how to create an object which is in a class which is in a module, and I learned that RBG LEDs have three pins.
## Hello VS Code
### Objective
We learned how to use VS code by printing a message on to the serial monitor.
### Pictures
### Lessons
I learned how to use VS code and how to se it up to run your code and I also learned how to upload it to github.
## Fancy LED
### Objective
Use VS code to make six LEDs blink in different patterns.
### Pictures
### Lessons
In this assignment I learned more about classes objects and modules. I also learned that its helpful to use a loop function to make your code neat and easy to read.
